# apexTracking
- Tracking stats in Apex Legends using OpenCV-python 
- Many of the comments are incomplete and parts of the mapping section aren't functional if downloaded from github due to requiring 250mb of packed key point data
- This repository is more 'for show' to give examples on openCV and other similar machine vision libraries
